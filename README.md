WOrking title: Tinder for bands


## Problem
In the current age of digital connection, it has become increasingly to get or stay in contact with people online.
Applications such as Tinder allow for a quick and effective way of meeting new romantic friends.
Yet still, as a musician or band, it can be very hard to find the right people to create music with. 
While platforms like Bandwith, Join-my-band or Vampr are a step in the right direction, they lack Tinder's user friendliness or are aimed mostly at solo artists and producers. The field is, in other words, in dire need for a true 'Tinder for bands'.

## The solution
A 'Tinder for bands' application where musicians from different levels can share their work, start collaborations and invite other musicians. Bands can join as a group to look for new band members and set up auditions.
